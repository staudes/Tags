Tags is a programm to automatically creaty symlinks from a central 'Tags' direcotry to marked directories.
The directories are marked by adding a '.tags' file which specifies how the directory should be linked.
A line in a .tags file has to contain the tag and can contain a name, seperated by a ",", which will be used as link name. 
If no name is given the directory name will be used as link name

A .tags file (in a directory "20181010_important") can look like this:
ProjectX
ProjectX/2018
Data, 20181010_ProjectX_important

in this case 3 links will be created
the directories "ProjectX" and "Date" and the subdirectory "2018" will be created.
additionally links from ProjectX/20181010_important, ProjectX/2018/20181010_important and Data/20181010_ProjectX_important to the
target directory will be created.

The programm is run with a config file, which specifies where to look and where to put the links.
The config file will look like this:
path1, path2, path3
path to tags-base directory

The programm should be able to run with cron
